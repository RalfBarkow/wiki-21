# Wiki 21 Sample GitHub Pages

We were pleased with how quickly a minimal revision of wiki client grew into being in about a month.

We got stuck after sketching several different ways to approach construction of DOM elements.

Run from githup pages.

Install the deno file_server

    deno install --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std@0.93.0/http/file_server.ts
